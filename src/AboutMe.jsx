                    I am Francisco Cuevas Coria, a front-end developer with a background 
                    in graphic design and digital marketing. My design experience provides 
                    me with a strong foundation in visual communication and user experience, 
                    which I now apply to building responsive, accessible, and performance-driven websites.
                </p>
                <p className="text-md pb-4 text-neutral-100">
                    My technical expertise includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, along with 
                    experience using TailwindCSS for modern styling, GitHub for version control, 
                    and Figma for design collaboration. I am committed to creating interfaces that 
                    balance clean design with reliable functionality, ensuring a seamless experience 
                    across devices. I thrive in collaborative environments, adapt quickly to new 
                    technologies, and focus on producing solutions that meet both user needs and 
                    organizational goals with precision and efficiency.
